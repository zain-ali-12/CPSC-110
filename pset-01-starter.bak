(@problem 1)
;;
;; Write the BSL expression that most clearly represents the following
;; arithmetic expression:
;;
;;     3^2 + 6 * (6 - 10) / 3
;;
;; which equals 1
;;
;; There is a single BSL expression that both produces the correct result, 
;; and most closely matches the structure of the equation given above.
;; Although 1 is an expression that evaluates to 1, that is not the
;; correct answer, because it doesn't show the structure of the expression
;; above.
;;






(@problem 2)
;;
;; Given the definitions below (LOWER, UPPER and foo),
;; write the step-by-step evaluation of the following expression:
;;
;;     (foo (* 3 4) (+ 0 2))
;;
;; Be sure to show every intermediate evaluation step, including the original
;; expression and the final result.  The steps should NOT be in comments.
;;
;; Stepping questions like this one have only one correct answer.  The goal
;; of this problem is to assess whether you have learned the exact BSL step
;; by step evaluation rules; not whether you can figure out the final
;; result of an expression.
;;

(define LOWER 10)
(define UPPER 20)

(define (foo x y)
  (if (and (> x LOWER) (< x UPPER))
      (- x (* y 2))
      (+ x (* y 3))))

(foo (* 3 4) (+ 0 2))


(@problem 3)
;;
;; Skye has written the following expression, and expects it to produce
;; "hahaha". Instead, there is an error.  Please correct the expression below
;; so that it produces "hahaha".
;;
;; First uncomment the expression, then fix it.
;;
;; When you are done, do NOT add the semi-colon back to the beginning
;; of the line, UNLESS your expression still produces an error. 
;;
;; Remember the Help Desk can be used to access documentation on
;; BSL primitive functions.

(@problem 4)
;;
;; Skye has now written the following expression, and expects it to produce
;; "so". Instead, "o" is produced. Please uncomment and then correct the
;; expression below so that it produces "so".
;;

(@problem 5)
;;
;; Skye has now written a function that is supposed to produce the given image
;; with a caption underneath it. Please correct the expression below so that
;; it correctly produces a blue circle with the text "Blue Circle" under it.
;;
;; First uncomment the expression, then fix it.
;;
;; Do NOT change the function definition, just fix the expression that is
;; commented.  When you are done, do NOT add the semi-colon back to the
;; beginning of the line, UNLESS your expression still produces an error.

;;
;; NOTE: Do not attempt to solve this problem until you have covered
;; the How to Design Functions (HtDF) design recipe in lecture.
;;
;; Design a function called taller-image that consumes two images and produces
;; the image that has the greater height.
;;
;; Note that the template origin tag for a function that consumes two images is:
;;
;; (@template-origin Image)
;;
;; and the template itself is:
;;
;; (define (taller-image i1 i2)
;;   (... i1 i2))
