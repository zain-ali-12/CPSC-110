A \textit{capacitor} is a basic circuit element that can store charge. 

\

A simple form of capacitor is a pair of conducting plates separated by a dielectric (non-conducting) material. There are other geometries possible such are rolling thin conducting plates and a malleable separating dielectric material into a cylindrical shape, all the while preserving the separation of the two plates. 

\

By attaching a battery, say, to the capacitor, we can store charge from the battery in the capacitor for use at a later time. The capacitor can then become a source of current in the circuit, at least until the capacitor has discharged.

\
\begin{enumerate}
 \setcounter{enumi}{1}


\item ($\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar\largewhitestar$) Suppose we have a capacitor of capacitance $C$ in a circuit with both a resistor of resistance $R$ and a battery with emf $\cal{E}$. All three of these values are constant. This circuit is shown in Figure 1. Note there is a current $I$, which is equal to the rate at which the charge $Q$ changes in time $t$; that is, $I=dQ/dt$. We wish to study $Q(t)$, the charge on the capacitor as a function of time.

We can apply Ohm's Law to this circuit to find that 
\[
 {\cal E} -IR -\frac{Q}{C} = {\cal E} - \frac{dQ}{dt} R - \frac{Q}{C} = 0.
\]
Note that this is a differential equation for the function $Q(t)$, which we rearrange as
\begin{equation}
\frac{dQ}{dt} = \frac{{\cal E}}{R} - \frac{Q}{RC}.
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let us assume the capacitor has no charge on it at time $t=0$. That is, $Q(0)=0$. Confirm that \[
Q(t) = C{{\cal E}\left(1-e^{-t/RC}\right)}
\]
is a solution of the differential equation (3) with the initial condition $Q(0)=0$.

\item Sketch a graph of $Q(t)$.

\item What is $\lim_{t\to \infty} Q(t)$? What can you conclude about the charge on the capacitor from this result?

\item Find an expression for the current $I(t)$. 

\item What can you conclude about the behaviour of this circuit after a long time passes?

\item Suppose that the charge on the capacitor is the value of $Q$ you found in Question 1(c); call this value $Q_\max$. Write down the solution $Q(t)$ to the differential equation you found in part (a) satisfying the initial condition $Q(0)=Q\max$. 

\item Sketch a graph of $Q(t)$.

\item Find an expression for the current $I(t)$.

\item ($\bigstar\bigstar\bigstar\largewhitestar$) The quantity $\tau = RC$ that appears in the solutions for $Q(t)$ in these $RC$-circuits is a time constant characteristic of these circuits; it has dimensions (units) of time and is a useful quantity to consider in practical applications.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate $Q(\tau)$ for the $RC$ circuit without the battery assuming the initial charge on the capacitor is $Q_0 \neq 0$.  Now, calculate $Q(\tau)$ for the circuit with the battery assuming the initial charge on the capacitor is 0.  What does $\tau$ measure in each of these cases?

    \item Engineers generally consider a charging capacitor starting with zero charge to be fully charged after a time period of $5\tau$.  They also consider a fully charged but discharging capacitor to be fully discharged after a time period of $5\tau$. Use calculations to help you explain why this practice can be considered reasonable?

    \item Assume the initial charge on a capacitor is zero and it is put in series with a resistor and an emf. Sketch the graph of the piecewise function giving the charge $Q(t)$ on this capacitor that results if you first charge the capacitor for a time period of $5\tau$ in this circuit, and then remove the emf from the circuit, leaving only the resistor and capacitor in series, and measure the charge on the capacitor for a period $5\tau$ afterwards. Assume you can remove the emf instantaneously from the circuit.
