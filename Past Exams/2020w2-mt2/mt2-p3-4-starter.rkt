;; This starter file contains one data definition, and then has two separate
;; function designs you must complete.  Both functions operate on the same
;; data definition, so this will save you time because you just have to learn
;; one data definition to design two functions.
;;
;; HINT: One of the problems in this file involves the try-catch template.
;;       Be sure that you use the template and the @template-origin origin properly.

;; Complete the design of the following function with signature, purpose,
;; commented out stub, check-expects, @template-origin tag and function.  You must
;; follow all applicable design rules.
;;
;; The function must consume a TTree and produce the number of nodes in the
;; tree for which all three children are false.  So, for example:
;; 
;;  (count-leaves TT1) should produce 0
;;  (count-leaves TT2) should produce 1
;;  (count-leaves TT3) should produce 3

;;
;; Complete the design of the following function with signature, purpose,
;; commented out stub, check-expects, @template-origin tag and function.  You must
;; follow all applicable design rules.
;;
;; NOTE: If it is reasonable to use the fold-ttree function then you will
;;       lose 20% marks from an otherwise correct solution if you do not
;;       use it.
;;
;;       If it is not reasonable to use the fold-ttree function, but you
;;       do use it then you will lose 30% off an otherwise correct solution.
;;
;; The function must consume a TTree and an integer, and search the tree
;; for the first node with that key.  If found it should produce that node's
;; value. It should fail if not found.
