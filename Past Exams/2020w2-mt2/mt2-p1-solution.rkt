In the call arrows constant you must replace every "???" string with one of the
strings "NH" (natural helper), "NR" (natural recursion), or "NMR" (natural
mutual recursion).

	(list 2 "NMR")
	(list 3 "NR")
	(list 4 "NH")
	(list 5 "NMR")
	(list 6 "NR")))

In the correspondences constant you must replace every "???" string with one of
the strings "A" to "I" indicating with reference arrow corresponds to the call
arrow with that line's number.

	(list 2 "B")

ERRORS AND FAILING TESTS

A file that does not run may earn as few as zero marks.  At this point in the
term there is no reason for you to hand in a file that does not run.  Run your
work often while filling in the reference-arrows and call-arrows and you will
have no problem being sure your file runs. Also be sure to run EVERY TIME BEFORE
YOU SUBMIT.

We have special checks (tests) at the end of the file.  Any tests that fail
indicate that you have not understood or followed the instructions on how to
form your answer.  Files that have failing checks may earn as few as zero marks.
IF YOU GET A FAILING CHECK, take the time to CAREFULLY READ THE MESSAGE.  We
have designed these tests so that the name of the failing tests indicates what 
is incorrect.

If you get more than one error or failing test we recommend fixing the first
one and then re-running before trying to fix the later ones.
