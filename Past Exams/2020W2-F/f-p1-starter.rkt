;; PROBLEM
;;
;; Write the signature for the following abstract function.
;;   Do your SCRATCH WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE, and then 
;;   put your FINAL ANSWER in the @signature ABOVE the function definition.
;;
;; Make sure your file runs properly before submitting it.  Running won't do
;; much, but it will ensure your parentheses are balanced etc.  That will
;; allow it to be autograded.  Submissions that do not run properly may
;; be penalized up to 100%.

;; Uncomment the following line and put your signature in the tag as usual.
;(@signature )

(define (foo a b c d)
  (cond [(a c) d]
        [else
         (cons (b (first c))
               (foo a b (rest c) d))]))
