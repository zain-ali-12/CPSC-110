;; Complete the design of the following function by writing the template tag
;; and the function definition.  Your answer must use built-in abstract
;; functions.  Any answer that includes any part of the recursive Natural
;; template or the (listof X) template will receive 0 marks.  You are free
;; to add additional check-expects if those examples are helpful for you.
