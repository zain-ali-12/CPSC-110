Complete the design of the function below by writing the template origin tag
and the function definition.  

NOTE: This problem will be autograded, and ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE ESSENTIAL
      IN YOUR SOLUTION.  Failure to follow these requirements may result in
      receiving zero marks for this problem.

 - The function you design MUST BE CALLED max-width.
 - You MUST NOT COMMENT out any @ metadata tags.
 - You MUST NOT EDIT the provided tests.
 - You MUST NOT EDIT any part of the file above the first line marked with ***.
 - You MUST FOLLOW all applicable design rules.
 - The file MUST NOT have any errors when the Check Syntax button is pressed.

 - The function definition MUST call one or more built-in abstract functions.

 - You must define a single top-level function with the given name. You are
   permitted to define helpers, but they must be defined within the the
   top-level function using local.

 - The function definition and any helper functions you design MUST NOT be
   recursive.

 - The result of the function must directly be the result of one of the
   built-in abstract functions. So, for example, the following would not
   be a valid function body:

       (define (foo x)
         (empty? (filter ...)))

   This would be a valid function body:

       (define (foo x)
         (local [(define (helper y) (foldr ... ... ...))]
           (helper ...)))
