YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE STEPPER AT ANY POINT IN THIS EXAM.

Problems 1 and 2 of this midterm both use the following data definitions.

After reviewing the data definition you can find the problem description below.

Complete the design of the following abstract fold function for Professor.
Note that we have already given you the actual function definition and the
template origin tag. You must complete the design with a signature, purpose,
and the two following check-expects:

  - uses the fold function to produce a copy of P9
  - uses the fold function to count the total number of profs in P9,
    which is 9

Be VERY CAREFUL WRITING THE SIGNATURE. You must have a SINGLE uncommented
@signature tag. The autograder is very picky about these problems. If you
skip the type of one parameter then the types of all following parameters
will probably be marked wrong. On the other hand an incorrect type typically
does not affect anything after it. So work very carefully to first setup the
number of parameters the function has, and be sure your final answer has
types for that many parameters. HINT, there are 6.

This problem will be autograded.  NOTE that all of the following are required.
Violating one or more will cause your solution to receive 0 marks.

 - You MUST NOT edit the provided fold-prof function definition or
   the template origin tag.

 - Your copy test and count tests must use the CONSTANT P9, they must
   not use the equivalent (make-prof "Hanrahan" 50211 ...)

 - You must have a single uncommented @signature tag.  Because it is an
   exam you may leave commented scratch work in the submission.

 - Your submission must pass the Check Syntax button.
