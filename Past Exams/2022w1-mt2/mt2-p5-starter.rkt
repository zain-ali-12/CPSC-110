YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE STEPPER AT ANY POINT IN THIS EXAM.

In this problem you must complete the design of a function by writing the
template origin tag and the function definition.  

This problem will be autograded.  NOTE that all of the following are required.
Violating one or more will cause your solution to receive 0 marks.

  - The file MUST NOT have any errors when the Check Syntax button is pressed.
    Press Check Syntax and Run often, and correct any errors early.

  - The function definition MUST call one or more built-in abstract functions.

  - The function definition MUST NOT be recursive.

  - The function definition MUST NOT use any part of the recursive Natural
    template or the (listof X) template. For instance,

      - it must not include (cond [(empty? ... anywhere
      - it must not include (cond [(zero? ... anywhere
      - it must not include (first this) anywhere
      - it must not include (first that) anywhere

  - You MUST NOT change or comment out any check-expects, and you must not
    change the order of the existing check-expects, but you are free to add
    new check-expects AFTER the existing check-expects.

  - You are NOT PERMITTED to use member, member?, memq, memq or memv.

  - You should use built-in abstract functions appropriately to write code
    that is clear and easy to understand.
