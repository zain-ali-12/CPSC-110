Given the following data definition:

|#

(@htdd ListOfNatural)
;; ListOfNatural is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Natural ListOfNatural)
;; interp. a list of natural numbers

(define LON1 empty)
(define LON2 (cons 1 (cons 0 (cons 4 empty))))

(@dd-template-rules one-of
                    atomic-distinct
                    compound
                    self-ref)

(define (fn-for-lon lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) (...)]
        [else
         (... (first lon)
              (fn-for-lon (rest lon)))]))

Design a function that consumes a list of naturals and drops naturals from the
front of a list until it reaches a natural that is odd. So, for example:

(drop-until-odd (cons 2 (cons 5 empty)))

should produce

(cons 5 empty)

But note that it only drops until it reaches the first odd, so:

(drop-until-odd (cons 4 (cons 2 (cons 1 (cons 6 (cons 5 empty))))))

should produce

(cons 1 (cons 6 (cons 5 empty)))

because it stops dropping at the 1.

BSL has a built in predicated called odd? that you will want to use.

Your function design must include a @signature, purpose, commented out stub,
appropriate tests, a @template-origin tag, a @template tag, and a function
definition.

This problem will be autograded.  NOTE that all of the following are required.
Violating one or more will cause your solution to receive 0 marks.

  - Files must not have any errors when the Check Syntax button is pressed.
    Press Check Syntax and Run often, and correct any errors early.

  - You must define a function with the same name as in the @htdf tag below.
