In a continuing sign that the oligarchs are taking over the world, Elon Musk
has now bought the North Pole, including Santa Claus' entire operation there.
Unsurprisingly his first move was to fire half the elves.  His second move was
to realize that none of the packages are packed yet for this year's big delivery
run. With so many elves now fired it's going to be difficult to figure out how
to pack. Some of the fired elves were expert at that.

Before being fired one of the elves had started writing a solver to figure out
how to package all the gifts. Unfortunately she didn't get the program done, and
you have to finish it.

But fortunately she worked in a very systematic way, so you should be able to
get it completed. The analysis of the search tree is in f-p6-figure.pdf. Below
is the code file in its current state. As you will see, a lot of work has
already been done. In this problem you:
 
  - MUST COMPLETE THE 2 WISH LIST ENTRIES with check-expects, a template
    origin tag, and a working function definition 
  - SHOULD NOT HAVE TO, but are PERMITTED to change the check-expects for
    solve, in case your helpers produce results in a different order
  - SHOULD USE the has-room-for? helper that Eva has already written


NOTE: This problem will be autograded.
      **ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE ESSENTIAL** in your solution.
      Failure to follow these requirements may result in receiving zero marks.

 - the functions you design must conform to the wish list entries
 - you must design the two functions at top-level, with all recipe elements
 - you must include correct @htdf, @signature and @template-origin tags
 - you must not comment out any of the tags
 - your submission must pass the Check Syntax button
 - you must follow all applicable design rules
 - MUST NOT CHANGE the data definitions or example data
 - MUST NOT CHANGE the signature of any function
 - MUST NOT CHANGE the definition of any function for which there
   is already a complete definition
