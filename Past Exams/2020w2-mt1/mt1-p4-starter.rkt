;;
;; PLEASE READ THESE DIRECTIONS SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY AT LEAST TWO TIMES BEFORE
;; PROCEEDING.  FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS MAY CAUSE YOU TO LOSE ALL
;; MARKS FOR THIS PROBLEM.
;;
;; In this problem we are giving you a partially complete world program.  We
;; want you to complete the program by doing three things:
;;  1. Fix a mistake in the design for add-balloon. This is a small (one line)
;;     change.  If you find yourself doing more than one line you are doing
;;     too much.
;;  2. Fix two mistakes in the design of next-balloons and/or next-balloon.
;;     This is a larger change, but still somewhat localized.
;;  3. Complete the design of render-balloons. This requires completing a
;;     function design starting from the wish list entry.
;;
;; NOTE CAREFULLY:
;;
;; - Except for the @cwl annotation, do not edit any part of this file above
;;   the marked lines (right after the main function definition). Editing any
;;   part of the file above the marked line will cause you to lose all marks
;;   for this problem.
;;
;; - Your goal is to fix and complete THIS PROGRAM.
;; - In 1 and 2 you should fix the mistakes, so that the functions work
;;   properly (as stated in the purpose) and are consistent with design rules.
;; - In 3 of course you will have to do more work, but again be sure to stay
;;   consistent with the program we are giving you.  Don't improve it, complete
;;   it.
;;
;; - We recommend you solve the three parts in the 1, 2, 3 order.
;;
;; - You MUST follow all applicable design rules.  Correctly working functions
;;   that ignore the recipes will earn few if any marks. It might be the case
;;   that the person who wrote the code below did not always follow the
;;   recipes.  Just think, if they had, then your task would be easier!
