;; First read through the following PARTIAL data definition.  You do NOT need
;; to, and you MUST NOT edit or complete the data definition.
;;

(@htdd QualComp)
;; QualComp is one of:
;;  - "less-than"
;;  - "equal"
;;  - "greater-than"
;; interp. a qualitative difference between two quantities
;; <examples are redundant for enumerations>



;;
;; THE WORK YOU NEED TO DO begins here.
;;
;; Design a function that consumes two numbers and produces a QualComp
;; representing the relationship between the first number and the second.
;; Your function must be called compare.
;;
;; For example (compare 3.5 9) should produce "less-than".
;;
;; You must have a complete design including @htdf, @signature, and @template
;; annotations, as well as a purpose, tests, a commented out stub and a
;; function definition.
;;
;; If your file has errors that prevent it from running (red errors) then
;; you will lose no fewer than 50% marks.  Failing tests will also lose marks
;; but not as many.
