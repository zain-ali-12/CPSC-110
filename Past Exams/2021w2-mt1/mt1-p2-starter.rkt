(@problem 1) ;DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THIS LINE! (This is actually problem 2)
;;
;; Design a function that consumes 2 arguments - the x and y coordinate of a
;; point.  The function must produce true if the point is in the first quadrant
;; and false otherwise.  A point is in the first quadrant if its x and y
;; coordinates are both greater than zero. Do not assume that x and y will
;; always be integers.
;; 
;; The function must be called first-quadrant?  You must include @htdf tag,
;; @signature tag, purpose, sufficient tests, a commented out stub, a @template
;; tag, and a working function definition. 
;;
;; Note that:
;; - this problem will be autograded
;; - you must not comment out any @ metadata tags
;; - any submission for which Check Syntax fails will receive 0 marks
