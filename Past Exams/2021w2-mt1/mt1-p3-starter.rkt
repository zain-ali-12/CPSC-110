;; Below is a partial data definition.  It includes just the @htdd tag, and
;; the type comment.  You do not need the interpretation or the data
;; examples for this problem.
;;
;; You must complete the @dd-template-rules tag and the actual template
;; based on the type comment provided.  The order of the dd-template rules
;; and the template must be the same as in the type comment.
;;
;; Note that:
;;  - this problem will be autograded
;;  - you must not comment out the @dd-template-rules tag or the
;;    actual template function
;;  - any submission for which Check Syntax fails will receive 0 marks
