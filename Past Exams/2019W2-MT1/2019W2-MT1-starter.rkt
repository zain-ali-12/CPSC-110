;; Due to changes on the global market, the Canadian-based store has to change
;; the cost of all fair trade items by a certain factor. Please design a

;; produces a list of items with the updated prices.
;;
;; The factor is represented as a positive number and the new price of a fair
;; trade item is calculated as follows
;;     new-price = (current-price * factor)
;;
;; For example 
;; If the factor is 2 and the current price of a fair trade item is 10 dollars
;; The new price will be = (10 * 2) = 20
;; If the factor is 0.5 and the current price of a fair trade item is 10 dollars
;; The new price will be = (10 * 0.5) = 5
;;
;; You must follow all applicable design rules and include all
;; appropriate @tags.  Please use the Item and ListOfItem example constants
;; defined above in your check-expects.
