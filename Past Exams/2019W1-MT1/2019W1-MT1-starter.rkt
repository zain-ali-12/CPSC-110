;;   - Don't change things that do not need to change.  Do not entirely

;; Design a function that consumes an image, a width, and a height. The
;; function should determine whether the image fits inside of a rectangle
;; with the given width and height.  You must include all relevant recipe
;; elements and @tags. This includes a commented out stub.  You do NOT
;; need to have a commented out template.
;;
;; TO SAVE SPACE when writing your check-expects, you may assume that rect
;; is a primitive function that consumes JUST width and height and produces
;; a solid black rectangle of that height.  So
;;  (rect 2 3) is the equivalent of (rectangle 2 3 "solid" "black")
;; You can also abbreviate check-expect to c-e.

;;
;; One operation that a text editor can perform is to right-justify text.
;; This means adding enough spaces to the beginning of each line so that
;; the end of each line reaches a certain column.  Assuming the fill column
;; is 10, then (justify LOL3)  should produce:
;;
;;              (cons (make-ln 10 "0123456789")
;;                    (cons (make-ln 10 " 123456789")
;;                          (cons (make-ln 10 "        89")
;;                                empty))))
;;
;; Please design a justify function that consumes a list of lines and right
;; justifies those lines to FILL-TO.  You must follow all applicable design
;; rules and include all appropriate @tags.  Please use the Line and ListOfLine
;; example constants defined above in your check-expects.
;; You should include the following CONSTRAINT after the purpose:
;;
;; CONSTRAINT: No line may have more than FILL-TO characters.
;;
;; There is a primitive function called padding that you may call.
;;   (padding n) -> String
;;     n : Natural
;;   Returns a string with n spaces.
;;
;; NOTE do not design padding.  Assume that padding exists and design
;; the justify function described above.  No marks will be given for 
;; designs for padding.
