;; Design a function called stack that takes two strings and returns an image
;; with the image of the shorter of the two strings displayed above the
;; image of the longer of the two strings.  If the two strings have the same
;; length, the image of the first should be above the image of the second.
;; Use the provided constants as values for the text size and text colour.
;; Ensure that you follow the complete htdf recipe and include every required
;; element.  Also include a commented out copy of your function template.
