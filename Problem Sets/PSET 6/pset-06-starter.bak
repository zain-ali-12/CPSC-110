(@problem 1)
;; Below is the start of a data definition called Course that represents limited
;; information about UBC courses.  Below there are only two example data.  
;; Please complete this definition by adding constants C110, C213, C313 and C317
;; which are representations of the descendent tree for 110, 213, 313 and 317.  
;; You can find the information you need at
;;  https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/psets/pset-06-image.png
;;
;; NOTE 1: Use the information in the image above, rather than any other source.
;;         We are significantly simplying the information.
;;
;; NOTE 2: Do this very carefully, the autograder wants to see correct results
;;         from the functions you design to operate on this data.
;;
;; NOTE 3: The tree you will make for C110 will be a bit odd because 210 has 110
;;         as a pre-req, and both 213 and 221 have 210 as a pre-req, and313 has
;;         213 AND 221 as a pre-req, and 317 has 213 AND 221 as a pre-req. As a
;;         result, 313 and 317 will both show up twice in your descendent tree
;          for C110. This is okay for this problem set.
;; NOTE 4: Expect this step of the problem set to take you some time.
