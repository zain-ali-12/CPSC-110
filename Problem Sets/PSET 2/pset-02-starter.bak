;; The following function design may have errors in it.  Please fix the error
;; or errors that you find.  Any changes you make should preserve the existing
;; design intent.  NOTE THAT when fixing an error in existing code the best
;; practice is to change as little of the code as possible.  That is because
;; in most organizations someone will have to review any changes you make,
;; and changing only what you really mean to change will make that person's
;; job easier.  Remember always that the goal is to be kind to your fellow
;; programmers.
;;
;; First uncomment the entire function design, and then fix the error.
;; If you are unable to find and fix the error, leave it commented out.
;; Note that when fixing a bug in an existing program your goal should
;; be to have a light touch.  If there is a small simple way to fix
;; something then do it the small and simple way.
;;
;; Your solution must include @htdf, @signature, and @template-origin tags.
