;; If you are:
;;   - A 110 or 107 student replace the first set of '???'s with your cwl.
;;     For problem sets, If you have a partner, please replace the second
;;     set of '???'s with their cwl.  Remember this, it is what you will
;;     do with these @cwl annotations for the whole course.
;;   - A UBC Extended Learning student, replace the first set of ??? with
;;     your email address as confirmed in the email you received from
;;     extended learning.  The handin password is also in that email.
;;     Remember this, it is what you will do with these @cwl annotations

;; Bounce a single ball around the screen.

;; IMPORTANT:
;;   This problem set will form the basis for problem sets 4 and 5 as well.
;;   You are strongly advised to put in the effort to do well on this
;;   problem set so that you then have an easier time with problem sets
;;   4 and 5.
;;

;; For this problem set you must complete the design of a world program.
;; The complete program must have the following behaviour:
;;   - there is a green background, with a single white ball
;;     bouncing around inside that box
;;   - when the ball hits the top/right/bottom/left of the box it
;;     bounces in the usual way a ball would bounce off of a wall
;;   - clicking the mouse replaces the ball with a new ball, at the
;;     current mouse position, and with a small random x,y velocity
;;
;; Note that we are giving you significant help in the starter file.
;; There is a complete data design, some complete helper functions, as
;; well as a some wish list entries.  You absolutely MUST
;;  - not edit any of the complete design elements we give you
;;  - complete the wish list entries we give you, and do so in a way
;;    that is consistent with the rest of the design we give you
;;  - must use the helpers we give you as part of your solution
;;
;; We recommend that you begin by first going through the entire file to
;; understand what is already complete and what you need to complete.
